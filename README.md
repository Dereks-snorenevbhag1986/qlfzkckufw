OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Cleaner, and honestly, I’m all over the place about it. So, it's like Samuel L. Jackson is this ex-cop-turned-crime-scene-cleaner, and seriously, WHO even thinks of these jobs? I mean, I clean my kitchen at the bakery every day, but scrubbing blood?! No, thanks. Anyway, dude just goes and swirls into this whole drama — dead bodies, secrets, the works.

> You know that feeling after a long shift when you wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   and chill but end up all wired 'cause the plot’s just… wild? That’s where I’m at. But hey, the whole moral dilemma thing, should he or shouldn’t he, kind of hit home. Like when you’re stuck deciding if you should tell a customer their cake’s got, I dunno, too much cinnamon but not enough spice. It's a balance thing, you know what I mean?

And okay, I've got to rant about Eva Mendes; she’s in there amidst all the chaos, and I was like, how’s she always so sleek-looking? Must be the lighting or magic. If I ever get caught in that situation, I swear I’m showing up with flour on my nose and chocolate in my hair. Oh, and how he didn't 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? I think he actually figured out the whole conspiracy through VHS tapes or some ancient tech—like how retro is that, right?

Yeah, and they really make you side-eye every good deed out there. Like, cleaning up is just cleaning up, right? But nah, throw in a murder cover-up and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 everyone’s brains fry. It’s like burning a batch of soufflés — looks fine from the top but lava inside ready to explode! Ugh, tell me you’ve seen it, 'cause I need to hear your thoughts too before I spiral. 🤪

But wow, gotta crash soon, another early shift tomorrow, gotta make croissants before dawn. They don't just roll themselves, you know? Let's catch up later, maybe over coffee, or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   that doesn’t mess with my pastry zen. 🥐
